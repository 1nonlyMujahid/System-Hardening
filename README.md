In this group project, a Windows Server 2019 VM was used for system hardening to make it even more secure with the implementation of CIS controls. The choice of controls was based on that the machine will be used as a server in a small-sized business and to protect them from major attacks.

**The CIS controls that were implemented are:**
 1. Inventory  and  Control  of  Software  Assets  (Control  2)
 2. Data  Protection  (Control  3)
 3. Secure  Configuration  of  Enterprise  Assets  and  Software  (Control  4)
 4. Account  Management  (Control  5)
 5. Continuous  Vulnerability  Management  (Control  7)
 6. Audit  Log  Management  (Control  8)
 7. Email  and  Web  Browser  Protections  (Control  9)
 8. Malware  Defenses  (Control  10)
 9. Data  Recovery  (Control  11)
 10. Application  Software  Security  (Control  16)
 11. Incident  Response  Management  (Control  17)
 12. Penetration  Testing  (Control  18)
